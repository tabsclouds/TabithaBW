<p style="font-family:arial"> Responses to the video animations that I make from artists I have spoken with have included descriptions such as mundane, uncool, idiosyncratic and narcissistic. I have a propensity to create silent, slow and awkward to watch videos that are inspired by specific visual experiences that I have had and intend to further explore. My intention is to create videos that explore my own questions that I have around perception of digital spaces, objects and non-fixed images (e.g. digital and reflections). These ideas are presented in the form of videos and animations in such a way that is not explanatory or rigid. Instead the videos work to encourage a non-scientific, artistic approach to explaining our interactions with the digital image. Through making these artworks I have found that the purely scientific explanations leave a gap between the physical and chemical functions and structures that explain the human-digital interaction and the immediate, instinctive experiences that I have. The purpose of this approach is to make a case for a more artistic and cartoon approach to unpacking how we perceive the digital world.
   </p>
   <p style="font-family:arial"> My artistic practice sets out to explore and test out different ways of interacting with the digital world. The videos I make set out to unpack with how we perceive our interaction with and relation to digital/virtual images. In the videos, the digital image is likened to a cartoon object. Through the use of my cartoon characters, Charac and Other, the videos question how the cartoon-like experience of interacting with digital information and objects effects out interaction with the world. 
   </p>
    <p style="font-family:arial"> Charac and Other are two animated exploring the idea of treating the photographic image as a space that can be entered into. Their first animated movements were inspired by Andy Holden’s Laws of Motion in a Cartoon Landscape in a video animation titled The illusions, delusions and endeavours to enter the photographic world. [2017-2018]. This video explored the notion of entering or failing to enter the illusionistic space of a flat photograph through techniques inspired by classic cartoon laws of motion.  
   </p>
    <p style="font-family:arial"> The illusions, delusions and endeavours to enter the digital photographic world. [2018] explores the materiality of the digital photographic image by having Charac and Other perform actions and gestures that echo actions possible in photo editing software (e.g. stretching, distorting) as well as actions possible in a non-digital context (e.g. folding paper). Furthermore, Charac endeavours to enter into the illusionistic photographic space whilst Other partly facilitates and partly inhibits this almost impossible process. 
   </p>
    <p style="font-family:arial"> An exploration of how to hold and touch digital images [2018-2019] explores the idea that digital images/objects exist in a way that is akin to how objects and characters exist in the cartoon landscape. This exploration consists of two works. In the video animation Charac and Other and a Reflection [2018-2019], Charac transforms a reflection into a solid, pick-up-able object through the action of removing it from its original video/real-world context and bringing it into the white screen space (quasi cartoon landscape). Cat and Information [January 2019 – April 2019] combines audio recorded in January 2019 with video recorded in April 2019. The audio is of a conversation with a scientist discussing our human interaction with digital objects. The video features a cat trying to catch and hold a laser dot. Combining the videos brings together two different approaches to tackling the question of what our interaction with digital images, objects and information is. The video serves to compare and contrast a very technical, scientific and considered approach with an instinctive, intuitive and animal approach.
