<p style="font-family:arial"> My artistic practice sets out to explore and test out different ways of interacting with the digital world. My practice is concerned with how we perceive our interaction with and the relation we have to digital/virtual images.  </p>

<p style="font-family:arial">
Charac and Other are two animated characters created, in 2017, first as drawings exploring the idea of treating the photographic image as a space that can be entered into. Their first animated movements were inspired by Andy Holden’s Laws of Cartoon Motion in a video animation titled “The illusions, delusions and endeavours to enter the photographic world. [2017-2018]”. This video explored the notion of entering or failing to enter the illusionistic space of a flat photograph through techniques inspired by classic cartoon laws of motion.  </p>
<p style="font-family:arial">
Following on from this, Charac and Other were fleshed out with clothes and more solid faces. Now more present on screen and ready to explore their interactions with the digital photographic space. “The illusions, delusions and endeavours to enter the digital photographic world. [2018]” explores the materiality of the digital photographic image by having Charac and Other perform actions and gestures that echo actions possible in photo editing software (e.g. stretching and distorting) as well as actions possible in a non-digital context such as folding a piece of paper. Also, in the video Charac endeavours to enter into the illusionistic photographic space whilst Other partly facilitates and partly inhibits this almost impossible process.   </p>
<p style="font-family:arial">
In 2018-2019, I began an exploration of how to hold and touch digital images with an approach led by the idea that digital images/objects exist in a way that is akin to how objects and characters exist in the cartoon landscape. This exploration consists of two works. In the video animation “Charac and Other and a Reflection [2018-2019]”, Charac transforms a reflection into a solid, pick-up-able object through the action of removing it from its original video/real-world context and bringing it into the white screen space (quasi cartoon landscape).  In further exploration of the experience of interacting directly with a digital image/object is the video “Cat and Information [January 2019 – April 2019]”. This video combines audio recorded in January 2019 with video recorded in April 2019. The audio is of a conversation I had with Sam Daffern MSc, a genetics PhD student, where he explains to me what our human interaction is with digital objects. While the video is of a cat named Klaus. In the video Klaus is trying to catch and hold a laser dot, the position of which I was controlling. Combining the videos brings together two different approaches to tackling the question of what our interaction with digital images, objects and information is. The video serves to compare and contrast a very technical, scientific and considered approach with an instinctive, intuitive and animal approach.   </p>
<p style="font-family:arial">
Responses to my videos from artists I have spoken with have included descriptions such as mundane, uncool, idiosyncratic and narcissistic. I have a propensity to create silent, slow and awkward to watch videos that are inspired by specific visual experiences that I have had and want to further explore. My intention is to create videos that explore my own questions that I have around perception of digital spaces, objects and non-fixed images (e.g. digital and reflections). Then to present these ideas in a way that is not explanatory or rigid but open and non-factual as a way to encourage a non-scientific and artistic approach to explaining our interactions with the digital image. Through making these artworks I have found that the purely scientific explanations leave a gap between the physical and chemical functions and structures that explain the human-digital interaction and the immediate, instinctive experiences that I have. The purpose of this approach is to make a case for a more artistic approach to unpacking how we perceive the digital world.
